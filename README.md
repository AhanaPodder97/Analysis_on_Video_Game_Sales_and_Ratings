# Evolution of Video Games

## About:
This project provide an in-depth view into the dynamic world of video games, offering a comprehensive analysis of sales and ratings across diverse platforms and publishers over the years. The dataset is taken from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/video-game-sales-and-ratings). The main goal is to bring light upon various insights about the video game industry over the years by analysis and visualization of datasets which contains valuable facets of information. In this project for data cleaning and transformation I have used Microsoft Excel and for data analysis and interactive dashboard for visualization I have used Tableau.
