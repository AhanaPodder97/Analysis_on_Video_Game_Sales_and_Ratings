# Insight Planning: #

This phase needs strong understanding of each column in each table in the database and what does it represent. After this, the insights start to float.
For this project, I am interested in some points:

•	The total number of games created, their developers, publishers and platforms

•	Number of games released over the years

•	Average Critic Score vs. Average User Score over the years

•	Number of games created by each platform

•	Top 10 Games with most sales made globally

•	Top 10 developers according to number of games they created

•	Which platform creates more games and their evolution over the years

•	The number of games created each year

•	Which genre of games is mostly created and played

•	Total number of developers work for each platform and how does it affect their productivity
